TITLE: KBC QUIZ COMPETITION
NAME:ROHIT MARIWALLA
MIS : 111303051

My project consists of 3 files: 
KBC.c , questions.txt and options.txt.

The project has been modelled on the Tv show Kaun Banega Crorepati. There a total of 23 questions in questions.txt
from which any 13 will be asked to the contestant generated randomly. There are 3 lifelines given to the cotestant
if he finds a question difficult. Every lifeline can be chosen only once. No questions are repeated. Every question 
has an associated prize money.  There are two safe marks which are at Rs.10,000 and Rs.3,20,000, which if won, 
he/she will atleast take away Rs.10,000 or Rs.3,20,000 respectively. 
The candidate can quit the game by entering 'Q' instead of the option number.
The three lifelines are 1.Double Dip ie answering one question twice
2. Ask the experts which gives one or two more likely answers to the candidate 
3. Audience poll which displays random percentages of likelihood of options being the correct answer.
The options.txt file has the options fot the questions.
